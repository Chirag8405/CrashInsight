# 🚀 Deploy CrashInsight to Netlify (Full-Stack)

## ✅ **Yes! You can deploy everything on Netlify**

Your entire CrashInsight application (frontend + backend + dataset) can be deployed on **Netlify** using **Netlify Functions** for the backend. This keeps everything in one place!

## 📋 **What We've Set Up**

### 🔧 **Netlify Functions Backend**
- ✅ **Serverless Python functions** in `netlify/functions/api.py`
- ✅ **All ML models** (Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-means clustering)
- ✅ **Dataset processing** (49MB CSV automatically included)
- ✅ **CORS configuration** for frontend communication

### 🎨 **Frontend Configuration**
- ✅ **Environment variables** pointing to Netlify Functions
- ✅ **Build configuration** in `netlify.toml`
- ✅ **Development setup** with Netlify Dev CLI

### 📊 **Dataset Handling**
- ✅ **Included in repository** (under 100MB limit)
- ✅ **Automatically deployed** with your functions
- ✅ **No external hosting needed**

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### **Option A: One-Click Deploy (Easiest)**

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Netlify Functions support"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your `CrashInsight` repository
   - **Build settings** (should auto-detect from netlify.toml):
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `dist`
     - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

3. **That's it!** ✨
   - Your site will be available at: `https://crashinsight-[random].netlify.app`
   - Backend API at: `https://crashinsight-[random].netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api`

### **Option B: Manual Setup with Custom Domain**

1. **Create Netlify account and site**
2. **Connect GitHub repository**
3. **Configure build settings**:
   ```
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: dist
   Functions directory: netlify/functions
   ```
4. **Set custom domain** (optional)

## 🛠️ **Local Development**

### **Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Install frontend and Netlify CLI
npm install

# The netlify-cli is included in devDependencies
```

### **Run Development Server**
```bash
# Start Netlify Dev (runs both frontend and functions)
npm run dev

# This will start:
# - Frontend at http://localhost:8888
# - Functions at http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/api
```

### **Alternative: Separate Development**
```bash
# Run only frontend (if you want to use the old Flask backend)
npm run dev:vite

# In another terminal, run Flask backend
cd backend && python app.py
```

## 🔍 **API Endpoints**

Your Netlify Functions will provide these endpoints:

- **Health Check**: `/.netlify/functions/api/health`
- **Basic Stats**: `/.netlify/functions/api/stats`  
- **Time Analysis**: `/.netlify/functions/api/time-analysis`
- **ML Models**: `/.netlify/functions/api/ml-model`
- **Clustering**: `/.netlify/functions/api/clustering?clusters=5`

## 🧪 **Testing Your Deployment**

### **Health Check**
Visit: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api/health`

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "data_loaded": true,
  "total_records": 208804
}
```

### **Frontend Test**
Visit: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
- Should load your React app
- Dark/light mode toggle should work
- Dashboard should load with data from Netlify Functions

## 💰 **Netlify Pricing**

### **Free Tier** (Perfect for your project)
- ✅ **100GB bandwidth/month**
- ✅ **Unlimited sites**
- ✅ **125,000 serverless function requests/month**
- ✅ **Custom domains**
- ✅ **SSL certificates**
- ✅ **Continuous deployment**

### **Pro Tier** ($19/month - if you need more)
- 400GB bandwidth
- Background functions
- More function execution time

## ⚡ **Advantages of Netlify Deployment**

### ✅ **Single Platform**
- Frontend + Backend + Hosting all in one place
- No need to manage separate services
- Unified deployment and monitoring

### ✅ **Serverless Benefits**
- Automatic scaling
- Pay only for what you use
- No server management needed
- Global CDN included

### ✅ **Developer Experience**
- Git-based deployments
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Built-in CI/CD
- Environment variables management

### ✅ **Performance**
- Global edge network
- Automatic optimization
- Built-in caching

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Function Timeout Issues**
If ML model training takes too long:
```python
# In netlify/functions/api.py - already optimized:
# - Reduced model complexity
# - Limited data processing
# - Efficient algorithms
```

### **Memory Limits**
Netlify Functions have 1GB memory limit:
- ✅ Your dataset (49MB) fits comfortably
- ✅ Models are optimized for memory usage

### **Cold Start Delays**
First request might be slow (2-5 seconds):
- ✅ Global analyzer instance caches data
- ✅ Subsequent requests are fast

### **Build Issues**
```bash
# If build fails, check:
npm run build  # Test locally first
netlify build  # Test Netlify build locally
```

## 🌐 **Custom Domain Setup**

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to Site settings → Domain management
   - Add custom domain
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

2. **Update API URLs** (if needed):
   - Netlify automatically handles function routing
   - No code changes needed!

## 📊 **Monitoring & Analytics**

### **Function Logs**
- View in Netlify Dashboard → Functions
